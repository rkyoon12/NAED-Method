# A non-autonomous equation discovery method for time signal classification

This paper proposes a non-autonomous dynamical system framwork for time signal classification. We view time signal data $x(t)$ as continuous forcing term in a non-autonomous dynamical system of hidden variable $h:[0,T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$.
